					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s inspiring to see this, because most of the people I talked to concerning zero carbon homes by 2016 (for my 15000word dissertation) were somewhat pessimistic with it&#039;s practical implementation. However my dissertation took the matter further and investigated the implementation of a code of sustainable homes in developing countries.
I hope the strategies behind this dwelling can be applicable to both new and existing homes on a massive scale in order to make a significant carbon impact globally.
