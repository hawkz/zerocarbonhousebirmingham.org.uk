Their home is one part of an old Victorian terrace house and one part new build extension spread over three floors and built using recycled maple timber, floors made of compacted clay, a solar panel hot water heating system. It also features no conventional central heating - just a range of reflective surfaces and hatch doors to 'move' sunlight around the building warming the interior depending on where the sun is located in the sky.
