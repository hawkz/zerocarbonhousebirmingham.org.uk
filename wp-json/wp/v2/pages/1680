The south\/west triple-glazing on much of the garden elevation admits essential winter sunshine to warm the heavyweight building, and internal insulating blinds reduce heat loss at night.\u00a0 The glazing is designed so that the ash tree seasonally shades this glass: in winter the bare tree allows low angle sun to penetrate deep into the house.\u00a0 Ash trees come into leaf relatively late, allowing useful heat gains in the spring; but in summer the pinnate leaves shade the glazing from the high angle summer sun to prevent overheating, avoiding the need for motorised or manual external blinds.\u00a0 Again, this strategy has been monitored with research data verifying the results in practice.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The ash tree for timber<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The tree is also important in another different way.\u00a0 Tree surgery was required as a planning condition, and that timber has provided all the fuel needed for top up heating during the first six\u00a0winters. During the very coldest weeks of the year, a\u00a07kW high efficiency clean-burn wood stove is used for the top-up for both heating and hot water, putting about 80% of its output into the cylinder. The house was first occupied in the exceptionally cold winter of 2009-10, and even when all the solar panels were covered in snow, the wood-burning stove needed to be lit for a few hours only every two to three\u00a0days.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\">You might also be interested in:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Technical\" href=\"\/technical\/\">technical<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/technical\/insulation-and-airtightness-technical\/\">insulation and airtightness (technical)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/technical\/defining-a-zero-carbon-standard\/\">defining a zero carbon standard<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To achieve zero use of fossil fuel, we need to have on-site renewable energy.\u00a0 A feasibility study of the zero&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2805,"parent":2137,"menu_order":2,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-1680","page","type-page","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1680"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1680"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1680\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3344,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1680\/revisions\/3344"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2137"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2805"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1680"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
