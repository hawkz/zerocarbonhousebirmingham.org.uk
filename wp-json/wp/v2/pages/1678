Typical wall construction uses 280mm of insulation fitted to the outside face of both the new and existing masonry at the side and rear.\u00a0 After negotiations with manufacturers it was agreed that all mechanical fixings could be designed out, as these would compromise thermal performance. The insulation is grey as it includes graphite to improve radiant heat transmission.\u00a0 It is finished in a vapour-permeable external render with some colour accents.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Internal insulation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The front elevation of the original house is internally insulated to preserve its brickwork and stone features.\u00a0 As there were no historic interiors, it is lined with timber battens, breather paper and 350mm cellulose insulation from newspaper.\u00a0 Inside, a light timber framework independent of the external wall supports the variable vapour-permeability airtight membrane and lime plaster finish. Insulating wall ties maintain structural and thermal integrity.\u00a0 The greater wall thickness is put to good use by forming window seats.\u00a0 Insulation wraps down through the cellar and beneath the old and new floors.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Roof insulation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Above, a new 450mm void is framed out beneath the retained existing slate roof.\u00a0 The new roof has 400mm of cellulose insulation between timber I-beam rafters, over-boarded with 100mm wood-fibre boards to give an improved decrement factor &#8211; that is slowing down the rate at which heat from external solar gains moves through the structure.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Windows<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The triple-glazed opening windows have a slim 25mm external frame, which is covered with insulation externally.\u00a0 Adjacent fixed windows are detailed as frameless stepped-edge triple-glazing sealed straight to the airtight membrane.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Membranes<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The airtight system of grommets, membranes and tapes was able to seal even the most complex existing and new junctions.\u00a0 This has resulted in excellent airtightness results. It is 28 times better than the airtightness of the original building.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\">You might also be interested in:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/design\/ventilation\/\">ventilation<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Technical\" href=\"\/technical\/\">technical<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Defining a zero carbon standard\" href=\"\/technical\/defining-a-zero-carbon-standard\/\">defining a zero carbon standard<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/resources\/suppliers\/\">suppliers<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\"><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Insulation and airtightness are essential components in reducing the need for fossil fuels.
