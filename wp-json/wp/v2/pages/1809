The way in which\u00a0we live in our homes can make a five-fold difference to the energy we use.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re very conscious of the changing seasons as the daylight, electricity and hot water we harvest fluctuate day by day. \u00a0Despite this, the temperature inside the house remains very steady. \u00a0On the coldest frosty winter days, when it might be -12C outside, it\u2019s usually also sunny with a clear sky so, perhaps surprisingly, we might be generating solar hot water at 5OC just when we need it most. \u00a0Over six winters so far we\u2019ve never needed to light our wood-burning stove from early February onwards: the sun has done the rest.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFeeling so closely in touch with the energy used in the house helps to influence the other choices we make over transport, food, recycling etc. \u00a0Although we\u2019re not perfect, we try to think more about the carbon footprint of our whole lifestyle.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\">You might also be interested in:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"An English house that generates as much as it consumes (New York Times, December 2010)\" href=\"\/about\/\">about<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/about\/john-christophers\/\">meet the architect<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"An English house that generates as much as it consumes (New York Times, December 2010)\" href=\"\/awards-media\/an-english-house-that-generates-as-much-as-it-consumes\/\">An English house that generates as much as it consumes<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>John Christophers, an architect, Jo Hindley, a midwife, and Theo, who was aged four, moved into\u00a0zero carbon house in 2009.&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3189,"parent":1581,"menu_order":5,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-1809","page","type-page","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1809"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1809"}],"version-history":[{"count":21,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1809\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3715,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1809\/revisions\/3715"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1581"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3189"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1809"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
