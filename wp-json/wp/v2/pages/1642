In our zero carbon house we use rainwater rather than refined water as much as possible.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Rainwater tank<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In our former coal cellar we now have a 2,500L rainwater harvesting tank. We filter and store rainwater collected from our roof, which we use for flushing the WCs, washing clothes and for a rainwater tap in the kitchen. \u00a0This reduces the amount of metered water we use by approximately 50 per cent.\u00a0 It also reduces the amount of rainwater discharged into the drainage system.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Dual flush toilets<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Our Ideal Standard WCs are the first seriously low water usage ones to be made in the UK. The dual flush toilet uses 2.6\/4 litres rather than up to 13 litres in some UK WCs. And, of course, they flush with rainwater.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Rainwater\u00a0tap<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In the kitchen we have one tap for refined water and another that delivers rainwater from the roof. We use that for washing down and scrubbing carrots\u2026any job where purified water isn\u2019t necessary.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reused bath water<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Water from the bath can be diverted to a water butt barrel in the garden, which is used for watering the plants.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Recycling storage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We recycle as much of our glass, plastics and paper as possible and compost our vegetable peelings.\u00a0\u00a0 We therefore have built-in storage space for our recycling in the kitchen to make this easy for us.\u00a0 Likewise, we have a convenient storage space for our bicycles in the lobby as, living in the city, it\u2019s easy to cycle to school and work.\u00a0 Having the bikes accessible but out of the way is all part of the zero carbon house design.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Recycled site waste<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When the house was being built, 99 per cent of all the construction waste was recycled with great diligence by the contractors Speller Metcalfe. They received a national Considerate Constructors award for their work.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\">You might also be interested in:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Thanks to all who helped us\u2026\" href=\"\/design\/\">design<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Thanks to all who helped us\u2026\" href=\"\/resources\/suppliers\/\">suppliers<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Thanks to all who helped us\u2026\" href=\"\/resources\/thanks\/\">thanks to all who helped us<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Water itself is a renewable resource but there is a hidden energy cost in cleaning, purifying and pumping water into&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3188,"parent":2030,"menu_order":5,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-1642","page","type-page","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1642"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1642"}],"version-history":[{"count":9,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1642\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3332,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1642\/revisions\/3332"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2030"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3188"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1642"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
