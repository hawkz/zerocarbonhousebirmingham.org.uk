Coming back, I became aware that development issues and global issues were linked not so much to policies in Africa but to a lack of understanding back in the West.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd it seemed to me at the time \u2013 I\u2019m talking about the eighties \u2013 that green issues, which were often regarded as fringe issues then, were in fact very central issues to a global outlook. So those issues have been very important to me since, and my architectural thesis looked particularly at energy and green building issues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve developed my interest in sustainable architecture throughout my work with Associated Architects.\u00a0I&#8217;ve worked variously as architect, associate and partner of the company for 30 years on a variety of award-winning and low energy buildings.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In 2005, Associated Architects won the national RIBA Sustainability award for\u00a0Cobtun\u00a0in Worcester, a home with a curved wall made from earth.
