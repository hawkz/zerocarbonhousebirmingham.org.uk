Aluminium is\u00a0high in embodied energy because of the energy used to mine and refine\u00a0it, while straw bales are low. A\u00a0house made using locally produced materials has a lower embodied energy than one built with imported materials, because of the energy used in transportation.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Normally the energy used to run a building over the course of its lifespan &#8211; through heating, cooling, light and power &#8211; is significantly greater than the embodied energy.\u00a0 The embodied energy might be 20 per cent of the building\u2019s total energy use while 80 per cent of the energy is used on\u00a0the day to day running.<\/p>\n<p>However, as the energy efficiency of a building increases, reducing the energy consumption, the embodied energy becomes a more significant proportion of the energy used overall.\u00a0With a zero carbon building, the\u00a0energy\u00a0consumed to create the building \u2013 including material extraction, processing and manufacture, transportation and assembly \u2013 is very\u00a0significant.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0embodied\u00a0energy\u00a0in\u00a0zero carbon house\u00a0is being assessed at present using the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.circularecology.com\/embodied-energy-and-carbon-footprint-database.html#.VZgIRouQnIo\" target=\"_blank\">University of Bath\u2019s Inventory of Carbon and\u00a0Energy\u00a0(ICE) methodology<\/a>.\u00a0Both\u00a0embodied\u00a0ene<wbr \/>rgy\u00a0(MJ\/kg)\u00a0and\u00a0embodied\u00a0carbo<wbr \/>n (kgC\/kg) are being considered.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the materials used in\u00a0zero carbon house\u00a0are very local, reclaimed, or at the minimal end of the\u00a0embodied\u00a0energy\u00a0spectrum.
