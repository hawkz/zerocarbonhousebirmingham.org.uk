Otherwise the air would quickly become stale and there would be a risk of condensation.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Heat exchanger and fan<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We have a fan and a heat exchanger called a mechanical ventilation heat recovery system (MVHR). Warm humid air is extracted from the bathrooms and kitchen and discharged outside &#8211; but it doesn\u2019t take the heat with it.\u00a0 Almost all the heat from the outgoing air (over 90%) is recovered and pre-warms the air that\u2019s coming in, which is ducted to reach every room in the house. \u00a0It also filters atmospheric grime from the incoming air.\u00a0 Although the MVHR uses some electricity, it saves several times more energy than it uses.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Natural ventilation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When it\u2019s warm we ventilate the house naturally by opening the windows. Every room has at least one tilt-and-turn window.\u00a0 We don\u2019t open them in the winter as that would let the heat out. But in the summer, when we don\u2019t need to keep the heat in, we throw open the windows and save energy by turning off the fan.\u00a0 During the spring and autumn, we can combine the natural and the mechanical ventilation by opening the windows during the day, when the air temperatures are higher, and putting the fan on at night.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Shutters<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are internal shutters from the bedrooms and stairs that can be opened or closed, to give a view into the living room below, creating an effect like an Elizabethan theatre.\u00a0 As well as being fun and offering the flexibility of changing the feel of the spaces, they provide additional light and ventilation when open.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\">You might also be interested in:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/design\/insulation-airtightness\/\">insulation and airtightness<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Technical\" href=\"\/technical\/\">technical<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Design\" href=\"\/design\/\">design<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A house as well insulated and airtight as zero carbon house has to be well ventilated.
