Prof Jankovic has found the house is not just zero carbon but carbon negative,\u00a0meaning that, over\u00a0the course of a year, the house\u00a0actually absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p>Defining a technical standard for sustainability is not easy.\u00a0 Although a variety of standards exist, they measure different parameters and are not readily comparable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Passivhaus standard<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The leading Passivhaus design standard, developed in Germany in the 1990s, was considered for zero carbon house. While respecting the rigorous work of Dr Wolfgang Feist on energy usage and thermal bridging, full Passivhaus accreditation of zero carbon house seemed too prescriptive an option at a time when no Passihaus retrofit standard existed. \u00a0In practice and in use, zero carbon house actually meets or exceeds many of the Passivhaus measures. (See\u00a0<a href=\"\/technical\/insulation-and-airtightness-technical\/\">Insulation and Airtightness (technical)<\/a> for a full comparison of Passivhaus standards with zero carbon house standards achieved.)<\/p>\n<p>Crucially, however, Passivhaus measures only energy use and does not look at other issues in the larger sustainability picture, such as where that energy is generated, its fossil fuel carbon profile, water usage, etc.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The UK Code for Sustainable Homes<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Another standard was published in October 2007 just as detailed design work on the zero carbon house was beginning: the <a href=\"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/technical\/level-6-of-the-uk-code-for-sustainable-homes\/\">Code for Sustainable Homes<\/a>.\u00a0 The Code certainly has flaws.\u00a0 Parts of the methodology, such as the rainwater calculations and materials ratings, can seem counter-productive.\u00a0 On site renewable energy is not a panacea.\u00a0 But the attempt at a holistic approach is surely very welcome when the joined-up nature of sustainability is still little understood in UK. The original Code covered nine areas:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Carbon dioxide emissions, and energy use, including requirements for heat loss, low energy lighting, clothes drying, A(+\/+) rated white goods &amp; cycle storage.<\/li>\n<li>Reduced water use, including the use of rainwater.<\/li>\n<li>Materials with low embodied energy and responsibly sourced.<\/li>\n<li>Minimizing surface water run-off to reduce flooding.<\/li>\n<li>Waste, including facilities for recycling, composting and management of construction site waste.<\/li>\n<li>Reduced pollution, especially from insulating materials.<\/li>\n<li>Health and well-being through good use of day-lighting and sound insulation.<\/li>\n<li>Management, including the process of construction, site CO<sub>2<\/sub>, water, air and pollution, and police security standards.<\/li>\n<li>Ecology, preserving wildlife and improving biodiversity.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Levels were rated 1-6, driven by the carbon reduction targets in the first section.\u00a0 Level 5 required a 100 per cent reduction in carbon as historically measured by the Building Regulations &#8211; principally heat loss.\u00a0 Level 6 went further, including hot water, lighting and electrical loads.\u00a0 For level 6, net carbon emissions needed to be zero, meaning no fossil fuels are used, only renewable energy.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0Code has now been\u00a0scrapped by the British Government but\u00a0it did\u00a0help to make a significant step change in UK housing and building practice. \u00a0The original version remains a rare example of the finest type of conviction politics, a precursor to the 2008 UK Climate Change Act, and the zero carbon house is designed to the original stringent standard.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of \u201czero carbon\u201d is now beginning to be understood more widely and it transforms our thinking: a building can actually produce at least as much energy as it consumes, and if its energy use is reduced sufficiently, it becomes feasible that it is entirely run from renewable energy.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Monitoring by Professor\u00a0Lubo Jankovic<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>zero carbon house<\/strong> is being monitored using the pioneering methods devised by Professor\u00a0Jankovic.\u00a0The instrumental monitoring of the house was\u00a0carried out to study the real life performance, collecting data of energy production and consumption as well as indoor thermal conditions.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Jankovic and his team found the\u00a0total annual heating energy has reduced from 59 MWh (based on the original two-bedroom 1840 house) to 1.78 MWh, and annual carbon emissions have reduced from 21,000 kgCO<sub>2<\/sub> to -660 kgCO<sub>2<\/sub>.<\/p>\n<p>More information on the way Professor Jankovik is developing the studies in zero carbon retrofit can be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bcu.ac.uk\/research\/stories\/designing-zero-carbon-buildings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Designing Zero Carbon Buildings<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\">You might also be interested in:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Technical\" href=\"\/technical\/\">technical<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Insulation and airtightness (technical)\" href=\"\/technical\/insulation-and-airtightness-technical\/\">insulation and airtightness (technical)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"What is a zero carbon house?\" href=\"\/about\/what-is-a-zero-carbon-house\/\">what is a zero carbon house?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/technical\/low-energy-building-database\/\">Low Energy Building Database<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>zero carbon house is\u00a0being extensively\u00a0monitored by Lubo Jankovic, Professor of Zero Carbon Design at Birmingham School of Architecture, Birmingham City&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2887,"parent":2137,"menu_order":5,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-1672","page","type-page","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1672"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1672"}],"version-history":[{"count":21,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1672\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":4379,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1672\/revisions\/4379"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2137"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2887"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1672"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
