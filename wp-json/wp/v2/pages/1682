It is the first UK retrofit house to achieve Level 6 of the Code for Sustainable Homes&#8230;. \u00a0The neighbours love it, particularly the cheery sunflowers in the front garden.<\/p>\n<p>While externally its character is very different from the rest of the area, the property adds to the urban streetscape. Full of quirky, delightful and well considered details and is a robust and thoughtful design of an exceptional\u00a0standard. In its first nine months of occupation the energy performance has outstripped even John Christophers&#8217; high expectations, proving energy-efficiency doesn&#8217;t mean compromising architectural space.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>\u00a0<strong>RIBA Manser Medal Shortlist 2011<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The prestigious medal\u00a0is awarded every year to the best new house designed by an architect in the UK.
