My images are often derived from fragments of medieval paintings, frescoes and icons. Recently the hand has provided a focus for my work, a framework for the exploration of frailty, vulnerability and the presence of the divine.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My work is created using an intaglio printmaking technique. Plates are made in a very physical way, scoring and cutting into the surfaces. Gold leaf is often applied to the paper prior to printing, making each piece unique. I think of these works as contemporary icons, points of stillness amidst a fast turning world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\">You might also be interested in:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Architectural design\" href=\"\/design\/architectural-design\/\">architectural design<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Wabi-sabi\" href=\"\/design\/inspirations\/\">inspirations<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Resources\" href=\"\/resources\/\">resources<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The\u00a0wonderful piece of art, Centre and Circumference, was installed on the top floor studio in zero carbon\u00a0house.
