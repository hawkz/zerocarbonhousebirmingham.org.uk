But how do you make an 1840 Victorian redbrick eco-friendly? Dominic Lutyens visits Britain\u2019s first retro-fitted, carbon-neutral family home<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"firstPar\">\n<p>Recent examples of green architecture normally bring to mind new-build structures intelligently designed to be as energy-efficient as possible \u2013 positioned to face exactly south to maximise solar gain, for example, and excellently insulated to minimise heat loss. But an even more environmentally friendly \u2013 and logical \u2013 solution is to convert an existing house into a carbon-neutral building.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"secondPar\">\n<p>The architect John Christophers has done exactly that. His ultra-experimental project is found in an unlikely spot: Balsall Heath, a quiet, seemingly traditional suburb of Birmingham with solidly Victorian redbrick houses that nevertheless has a vibrant, multicultural community.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"thirdPar\">\n<p>This family home, where Christophers lives with his wife, Jo, a midwife, and their six-year-old son, Theo, is Britain\u2019s first inhabited, retro-fitted house \u2013 an existing building upgraded to make it more energy-efficient and, in this case, totally carbon-neutral. It uses absolutely no fossil fuels.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"fourthPar\">\n<p>&#8216;There is another building in the UK like it, the Kingspan Lighthouse at the Building Research Establish\u00adment in Watford, but it\u2019s a prototype and no one lives in it,\u2019 Christophers says. &#8216;Our house, which was built in 1840, has achieved level six of the government\u2019s Code for Sustainable Homes, the highest rating for factors such as reducing carbon emissions and water usage. As over 80 per cent of existing houses will still be in use in 2050, it\u2019s essential that these get retro-fitted.\u2019<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read the full article:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/finance\/property\/green\/8447628\/Welcome-to-Britains-first-carbon-neutral-Victorian-home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Welcome to Britain&#8217;s first carbon-neutral Victorian home<\/a>\u00a0(Telegraph 14 April 2011)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #8fb258;\">You might also be interested in:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"An English house that generates as much as it consumes (New York Times, December 2010)\" href=\"\/awards-media\/an-english-house-that-generates-as-much-as-it-consumes\/\">An English house that generates as much as it consumes<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/awards-media\/awards\/\">awards<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"Awards &amp; media\" href=\"\/awards-media\/\">awards &amp; media<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The government\u2019s Renewable Heat Incentive has placed fresh emphasis on greening our houses.
