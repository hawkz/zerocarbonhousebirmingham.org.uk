The increase in carbon dioxide\u00a0is causing global warming, rising sea levels, extinction and more unpredictable weather patterns across the world. In order to change these patterns, we need to\u00a0reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that our homes produce.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Different ways of defining zero carbon<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>There is some controversy over what is included within the definition of zero carbon.\u00a0 In 2007, the UK Government created the world-leading\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/technical\/level-6-of-the-uk-code-for-sustainable-homes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Code for Sustainable Homes<\/a>,\u00a0a set of standards to assess the\u00a0complete environmental impact of new dwellings. To reach Level 6, the most exacting standard, all the energy you used in your home, whether from computers or washing machines or central heating, had to be renewable.\u00a0 In other words, no fossil fuels for anything at all.<\/p>\n<p>Other aspects of the Code cover water usage, daylighting, site ecology, etc.\u00a0 Although criticised by some, the Code has also been described as \u201cone of the finest pieces of conviction politics in a generation\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>However, in 2011 the Government sadly\u00a0watered down the original definition of zero carbon homes that the industry has been working to, and for which there was broad backing. While there was still a so-called zero carbon requirement, it no longer applied to all energy used within a home.\u00a0 Heating, lighting, hot water and building services were measured but disappointingly built-in electrics (hobs, ovens, washing machines) and all loose electrics (computers, TVs, supplementary heaters) were all ignored.<\/p>\n<p>Next, &#8220;small&#8221; housing developments were exempted, and a get-out called &#8220;allowable solutions&#8221; was introduced.\u00a0 Rushed through on the last day of Parliament in March 2015,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.building.co.uk\/code-for-sustainable-homes-scrapped\/5074697.article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Code for Sustainable Homes was finally abolished<\/a>, despite criticism from many. Even the Government\u2019s own Environment Audit Committee urged them to reconsider as the Code \u201chas been pushing up home building standards and creating a thriving sustainable building industry in the UK\u201d.\u00a0 There was widespread criticism of the July 2015 announcement <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2015\/jul\/10\/uk-scraps-zero-carbon-home-target\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">scrapping plans to make all new UK homes carbon neutral<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div>Aside from the politics of building standards,\u00a0zero carbon house\u00a0achieves\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/technical\/level-6-of-the-uk-code-for-sustainable-homes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Level 6 of the original UK Code for Sustainable Homes<\/a>, \u201ctrue zero carbon\u201d standard.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t burn fossil fuels for\u00a0anything in the home \u2013 heating, lighting, cooking, drying clothes, using computers, watching television.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><b>Carbon\u00a0negative house<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Technically, <strong>zero carbon house<\/strong> is not just carbon neutral &#8211; it&#8217;s carbon negative. \u00a0Over the course of a year, the house\u00a0generates more electricity than it uses, so it cuts CO<sub>2<\/sub> being produced elsewhere. <strong>zero carbon house<\/strong> is being\u00a0monitored\u00a0by Lubo Jankovic, Professor of Zero Carbon Design at Birmingham School of Architecture, Birmingham City University.
