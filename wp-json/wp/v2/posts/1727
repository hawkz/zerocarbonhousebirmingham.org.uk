You have achieved something really quite remarkable and your translation of vision into reality is truly inspirational, as was your impromptu and fascinating presentation. Quite aside from all the exemplary green aspects, I was also deeply impressed by your skilful use of space and light. The house seemed quite \u201cTardis\u201d like and I hope you all enjoy many happy years in it.<\/p>\n<p>It also reminded me of the successful integration (and fluidity) of living space and immediate environment in (the pictures and film I have seen of) leading contemporary Japanese domestic architecture.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it also seemed to have a grounded, peaceful and entirely human scale and feel. I work in the public sector and although we have won a couple of national awards for good corporate citizenship, I am sure that there is much we can learn from your pioneering work.<\/p>\n<p>I hope that, in time, your example can translate into standard construction practice generally and contribute to the world which we are leaving to the next generation.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk\/comment-page-2\/#comment-82\">1 November 2011 at 9:01 pm<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hannan\u00a0says:<\/p>\n<p>Thanks John and Jo for a great visit, the house is really interesting and the work you\u2019ve done is amazing.
