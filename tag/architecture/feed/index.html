										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It’s not over yet. The Save Smallbrook group is stepping up its campaign to rescue one of Birmingham’s most significant heritage buildings from demolition. We have instructed a top climate and heritage barrister to act on our behalf following the decision by Birmingham City Council to bulldoze The Ringway Centre.</p>



<p><a href="https://cornerstonebarristers.com/barrister/estelle-dehon-kc/">Estelle Dehon KC</a> is acting for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://brutifulbirmingham.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Brutiful Birmingham</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://the-modernist.org/" target="_blank">Birmingham Modernist Society</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://c20society.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Twentieth Century Society</a>&nbsp;and Birmingham’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/" target="_blank">zero carbon house</a>, who together make up the Save Smallbrook campaign group.</p>



<p>Depending on the outcome of our initial work, we will be launching a crowdfunding campaign to pay her fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why this is happening</h2>



<p>In September 2023, Birmingham City Council&#8217;s planning committee voted by a one-vote margin to raze the landmark Ringway Centre – a significant example of post-war commercial modernism – in favour of allowing three tower blocks, up to 54 storeys high, to be built on the Smallbrook site. See <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://eplanning.idox.birmingham.gov.uk/publisher/mvc/listDocuments?identifier=Planning&amp;reference=2022/08496/PA" target="_blank">Full planning application</a> <strong>REF 2022/08496/PA</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why this matters &#8211; climate change</h2>



<p>It’s a move that flies in the face of the city’s commitment to play a leading role in tackling climate change and becoming a net zero carbon city. The carbon emitted through adapting the Ringway Centre to make it into an energy-efficient building (retrofitting) is a fraction of the carbon emitted through demolition and starting again.</p>



<p>We are concerned that insufficient weight has been given to the environmental impact of the planning committee’s decision and have suggested a more eco-friendly form of development. See the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SBQ-counterproposal-FINAL-A.pdf" target="_blank">Counter proposal for Smallbrook Ringway</a>.</p>



<p>By the developers&#8217; admission, 187,219,000 kg of CO2 would be generated with these tower blocks, which is the same carbon emissions as an average UK car driving the whole way around the world 33,000 times.  In our counter proposal, we could create 450 homes for a tiny percentage of that. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why this matters &#8211; Birmingham&#8217;s heritage</h2>



<p>We are also concerned by the seeming lack of regard for the city’s architectural heritage. The Ringway Centre, which has been described as the Regent Street of Birmingham due to its length and sweeping curve, was designed by Rotunda architect James Roberts (1962).&nbsp; James Roberts was Birmingham-born and trained at Birmingham School of Art.</p>



<p>His work demonstrates a particular take on Birmingham Modernism and has been described as “frivolous Brutalism”. It has also been categorised as carchitecture as the repetition of the concrete relief and the bullhorn uplighters are designed to be seen from a moving car. The building is locally listed because of its important contribution to the streetscape. The buildings on either side of Smallbrook form the most intact example of post-war design in the city.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporters</h2>



<p>Our campaign to Save Smallbrook has significant supporters ranging from Brummie historian Carl Chinn to <em>Guardian</em> architecture correspondent Oliver Wainwright to Libby Harris of Birmingham Friends of the Earth. Architects, including Stirling-prize winners Haworth Tompkins, Caruso St John and Niall McLaughlin have also pledged their support. </p>

<p>The campaign to save Smallbrook Queensway has been covered by <em>The Birmingham Post</em> and <em>Private Eye</em>.</p>



<p>The Birmingham Post has published a robustly argued piece by Mary Keating: &#8220;Democracy demolished as objections hit a brick wall.&#8221; </p>



<p>Mary, who represents Brutiful Birmingham, has exposed how the <a href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/save-smallbrook-ringway/" data-type="post" data-id="4951">campaign to save Smallbrook Queensway</a> has not even had the opportunity to present a counter-proposal to the plans to demolish the 60s Brutalist building. This is despite the counter-proposal being endorsed by the winners of the Stirling prize, a prestigious architectural award, and expert scrutiny of the carbon implications of the development.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, is to meet the developers, Dooba Investments II Ltd, who are proposing the demolition of the heritage building to make way for a residential-led, mixed-use development of glass towers.</p>

<p>Private Eye has also reported on the campaign. They say that the Save Smallbrook Queensway campaign has demonstrated that a profitable scheme for 450 homes could be achieved without trashing Birmingham&#8217;s history.</p>
