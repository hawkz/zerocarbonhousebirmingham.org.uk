										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>Mary Keating of the Save Smallbrook campaign argues that the proposed demolition of Smallbrook Ringway Centre in favour of the building of tower blocks won&#8217;t help Brummies on the Housing Register.</em></p>



<p>Housing is a key issue for many of our local city councillors. There are thousands of families with small children living in temporary accommodation in Birmingham while waiting on the Housing Register for a home to call their own. This housing crisis was a major consideration for Planning Committee members when they voted to demolish Smallbrook Ringway Centre on September 28.</p>



<p>Plans to replace this elegant, 1960s, 6-storey sweep of building with three tower blocks of 48, 44 and up to 56 storeys are designed to provide a total of 1,632 flats in three phases which could take up to 14 years to complete. Seven votes to six, one vote was all it took to condemn Birmingham’s ‘Regent Street’ to oblivion. We need to understand if this development will help meet the city’s housing need.</p>



<p>22,000 families on Birmingham’s Housing Register are crying out for homes in the city. A development of this size might well go some way towards providing homes for some of these families. But to what extent is this the case? Unpacking the difference between social and affordable housing might bring greater clarity to the situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Difference between affordable and social housing</h2>



<p>What is the difference between affordable housing and social housing? Social housing is rented from the city’s housing organisation, Birmingham Municipal Housing Trust, or local Housing Associations. It is available to eligible families at up to 50% below commercial rates.</p>



<p>In the main, families on the Housing Register are looking for three- or four-bedroom homes whereas the vast majority of homes available from developments like Smallbrook Ringway Centre are one- and two- bedroom homes. There is no requirement that such developments offer any social housing and only a small proportion of the families on the Housing Register might be in a position to take up an offer of affordable housing in one of these blocks.</p>



<p>According to government guidance, affordable housing for rent usually comes in at something like 20% below the going commercial rate. The West Midlands Combined Authority uses a different, more equitable figure which is based on local people paying no more than 35% of their salary on mortgages or rent. The city has a policy which requires that all new developments of a significant size include the provision of 35% affordable housing. </p>



<p>This is rarely realised because developers can appeal to reduce their commitment on<br>grounds of financial viability. From an original 0%, a revised figure of 7% of the total number of 1,632 flats in the Smallbrook Ringway Centre development were set aside as affordable. These were primarily one- and two-bedroom flats and therefore unlikely to meet the needs of Brummies on the Housing Register. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Only 4.4% of the flats to be affordable</h2>



<p>As we understand it, further negotiations meant that the one- and two- bedroom affordable flats were replaced with three-bedroom affordable flats, a change which also involved a change in the method of calculation. At this stage, smoke and mirrors come to mind and it is hardly surprising that the financial arguments have proved difficult to unpack. The value of the affordable flats became the basis on which the percentage was calculated. Thus 10.5% became the percentage promoted by the developer, although the actual percentage of individual dwellings is 4.4% – albeit of three- rather than one- or two- bedroom flats.</p>



<p>When the application came before the Planning Committee the number of affordable flats had risen to 20%. This included the equivalent of 9.5% affordable housing supported by West Midlands Combined Authority Deeper Devolution Fund for which no application has yet been received. There is no guarantee this subsidy will be made available. Were councillors misled by these figures since the reality may well be very different?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unsuitable for families</h2>



<p>Even if the flats in the tower blocks planned for Smallbrook Ringway Centre were available at social rents, would they be suitable for families? Families need ready access to green spaces, schools, doctors’ surgeries, a whole raft of services and infrastructure that is not accommodated in these plans. </p>



<p>Retaining the existing building might be a useful starting point for an alternative approach. We have some excellent examples of retrofitted buildings in Birmingham, buildings which retain their original design externally but offer exciting new opportunities internally. At last, the wraps have come off the Beneficial Building (1961) on the corner of Paradise Street and Suffolk Street. Revealed is a handsome building repurposed as residential accommodation and retaining its original 1950s style. The Typhoo Tea Factory, a new home for BBC Midlands, will be a jewel in the crown of the regeneration of Digbeth. A similarly exciting approach to Smallbrook Ringway Centre could see Birmingham citizens in residence in no more than a couple of years and, incidentally, a cash-strapped city council in receipt of valuable council tax.</p>



<p>Without the Ringway Centre the area loses all its definition, including what is left of our 1960s heritage of which Birmingham should be proud. To bury this boulevard in multi-storey towers will be to cut off its light – the towers are planned for the south side of the street – and destroy its unique Birmingham personality. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Think more clearly about housing</h2>



<p>There is a critical need for clarity about the ways in which the present housing crisis can best be resolved. We need social housing to meet the needs of those on the Housing Register. We need affordable housing for those who cannot at present afford the exorbitant rents that are being demanded for new apartments. Birmingham does not need 14 years of demolition and disruption. Our world does not need the carbon impact of that demolition nor the increased demand on the environment of such extremely tall buildings. The housing needs of Birmingham citizens merit so much more thought and consideration than they are being afforded by the current Smallbrook Ringway Centre plans.</p>

<p>It’s not over yet. The Save Smallbrook group is stepping up its campaign to rescue one of Birmingham’s most significant heritage buildings from demolition. We have instructed a top climate and heritage barrister to act on our behalf following the decision by Birmingham City Council to bulldoze The Ringway Centre.</p>



<p><a href="https://cornerstonebarristers.com/barrister/estelle-dehon-kc/">Estelle Dehon KC</a> is acting for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://brutifulbirmingham.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Brutiful Birmingham</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://the-modernist.org/" target="_blank">Birmingham Modernist Society</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://c20society.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Twentieth Century Society</a>&nbsp;and Birmingham’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/" target="_blank">zero carbon house</a>, who together make up the Save Smallbrook campaign group.</p>



<p>Depending on the outcome of our initial work, we will be launching a crowdfunding campaign to pay her fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why this is happening</h2>



<p>In September 2023, Birmingham City Council&#8217;s planning committee voted by a one-vote margin to raze the landmark Ringway Centre – a significant example of post-war commercial modernism – in favour of allowing three tower blocks, up to 54 storeys high, to be built on the Smallbrook site. See <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://eplanning.idox.birmingham.gov.uk/publisher/mvc/listDocuments?identifier=Planning&amp;reference=2022/08496/PA" target="_blank">Full planning application</a> <strong>REF 2022/08496/PA</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why this matters &#8211; climate change</h2>



<p>It’s a move that flies in the face of the city’s commitment to play a leading role in tackling climate change and becoming a net zero carbon city. The carbon emitted through adapting the Ringway Centre to make it into an energy-efficient building (retrofitting) is a fraction of the carbon emitted through demolition and starting again.</p>



<p>We are concerned that insufficient weight has been given to the environmental impact of the planning committee’s decision and have suggested a more eco-friendly form of development. See the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SBQ-counterproposal-FINAL-A.pdf" target="_blank">Counter proposal for Smallbrook Ringway</a>.</p>



<p>By the developers&#8217; admission, 187,219,000 kg of CO2 would be generated with these tower blocks, which is the same carbon emissions as an average UK car driving the whole way around the world 33,000 times.  In our counter proposal, we could create 450 homes for a tiny percentage of that. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why this matters &#8211; Birmingham&#8217;s heritage</h2>



<p>We are also concerned by the seeming lack of regard for the city’s architectural heritage. The Ringway Centre, which has been described as the Regent Street of Birmingham due to its length and sweeping curve, was designed by Rotunda architect James Roberts (1962).&nbsp; James Roberts was Birmingham-born and trained at Birmingham School of Art.</p>



<p>His work demonstrates a particular take on Birmingham Modernism and has been described as “frivolous Brutalism”. It has also been categorised as carchitecture as the repetition of the concrete relief and the bullhorn uplighters are designed to be seen from a moving car. The building is locally listed because of its important contribution to the streetscape. The buildings on either side of Smallbrook form the most intact example of post-war design in the city.</p>

<p>The campaign to save Smallbrook Queensway has been covered by <em>The Birmingham Post</em> and <em>Private Eye</em>.</p>



<p>The Birmingham Post has published a robustly argued piece by Mary Keating: &#8220;Democracy demolished as objections hit a brick wall.&#8221; </p>



<p>Mary, who represents Brutiful Birmingham, has exposed how the <a href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/save-smallbrook-ringway/" data-type="post" data-id="4951">campaign to save Smallbrook Queensway</a> has not even had the opportunity to present a counter-proposal to the plans to demolish the 60s Brutalist building. This is despite the counter-proposal being endorsed by the winners of the Stirling prize, a prestigious architectural award, and expert scrutiny of the carbon implications of the development.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, is to meet the developers, Dooba Investments II Ltd, who are proposing the demolition of the heritage building to make way for a residential-led, mixed-use development of glass towers.</p>

<p>Private Eye has also reported on the campaign. They say that the Save Smallbrook Queensway campaign has demonstrated that a profitable scheme for 450 homes could be achieved without trashing Birmingham&#8217;s history.</p>

<div>
<div>BBC Radio presenter Adrian Goldberg has said it would be amazing for Birmingham if zero carbon house could be the model for homes everywhere.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
</div>
</div>
<div>The broadcaster was talking to owners John Christophers and Jo Hindley on a visit to their Balsall Heath home for the BBD Radio 4 Open Country programme Visions of Birmingham.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s a transcript of the end of the feature:</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><b><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></b></div>
<div><b><span style="color: #000000;">John Christophers:</span></b></div>
<div>&#8230;the new albion, the new England, should be full of zero carbon houses&#8230;</div>
<div><b><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></b></div>
<div><b><span style="color: #000000;">Adrian Goldberg:</span></b></div>
<div>It is a fantastic house.  I like the house where I live; but I must say if this house came onto the market I&#8217;d be very tempted to buy it.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>But again, you don&#8217;t want it to be the only house, and it would be amazing for Birmingham, wouldn&#8217;t it, if Birmingham could say: this is the model?</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>Not every house is going to be the same, not every house is going to have the same wishes and designs as you, but what you&#8217;ve done here: wouldn&#8217;t it be amazing if Birmingham said, we&#8217;ve got something original, something inspirational, in our midst?</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div></div>
<div>If it can be done in Balsall Heath, we can do it anywhere!</div>
<div><b><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></b></div>
<div><b><span style="color: #000000;">John Christophers:</span></b></div>
<div>We need to go round all our old housing stock, insulate it to a very, very good standard, put solar panels on the roofs where they&#8217;re facing the right way, reduce the running cost of these houses dramatically, give skills, give jobs to people in these difficult times, and I think it could make a fantastic vision of a green city.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
