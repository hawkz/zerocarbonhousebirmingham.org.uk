<p>All are warmly invited to <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86" data-type="URL" data-id="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86">RETROFIT REIMAGINED</a> mini-festival in Birmingham, 13-16 July!&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>zero carbon house is collaborating with: <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://civicsquare.cc/">Civic Square</a>, <a href="https://neweconomics.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://neweconomics.org/">New Economics Foundation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.architectscan.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.architectscan.org/">Architects Climate Action Network ACAN&nbsp;</a> and a galaxy of Retrofit stars to explore the question:</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p><strong>“What if the climate transition and retrofit of our homes and streets were designed, owned and governed by the people who live there?”&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Retrofitting means proper insulation to walls, floors, roofs; new windows and doors; ventilation with heat recovery, heat pumps, solar panels etc. The different measures will vary as every house is different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>zero carbon house is proud to be UK’s first zero carbon retrofit, now 13 years old. &nbsp;But by now there should be millions of others too….</p>



<p>Our old leaky homes seem to be the forgotten Cinderella, haemorrhaging massive amounts of heat. It’s really important these homes &#8211; and the people who live in them &#8211;&nbsp;are not left behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;People’s physical and mental health is badly affected by poor housing with mould, damp, condensation &#8211; and massive fuel bills.</p>



<p>Retrofitting our old homes properly, carefully, and to really high standards, we can make dramatic savings, with huge benefits to people’s lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re using so much energy now that, as David Attenborough, the <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/sgsm21228.doc.htm">UN</a> and others have shown, we’re destroying a liveable planet. &nbsp;Our homes generate a massive chunk of CO2, and at the same time push people into fuel poverty.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="David Attenborough, People&#039;s Advocate for #COP26, Address to World Leaders | Climate Action" width="1778" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o7EpiXViSIQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>But cutting home energy use (by 80%+) we can help those most in need, cut bills, improve people’s health and well-being, create high skilled local jobs, and help the planet at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Come along to the festival find out more…</p>



<p>The first day of <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86" data-type="URL" data-id="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86">RETROFIT REIMAGINED </a>is at zero carbon house&nbsp;</p>
