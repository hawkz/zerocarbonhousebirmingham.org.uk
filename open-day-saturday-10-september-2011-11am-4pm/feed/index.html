					<description><![CDATA[Hi it is the 8th Sept today, is the open day today or on the 10th which is Monday?
I am currently rebuilding a similar property in Streetly which I have previously gutted and would really appreciate any open visit opportunities to discuss levels of insulation that you have used and any quirky elements that you have retro fitted into your property.
Kind regards James]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would like to be included in the visit taking place on the 10th of September and to hear to talks that are to be given about the Zero Carbon house! I live locally and have a great interest in these issues!

 If you could confirm back to me this is agreeable to you, I would be honoured to attend!

Thank you for your time!
