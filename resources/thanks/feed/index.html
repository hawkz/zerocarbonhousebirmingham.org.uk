					<description><![CDATA[Hi John

Many thanks for the open day - it has certainly inspired us to look again at what we should be doing to our (slightly unusual) 1930s/1980s house to improve its energy performance (and maybe improve other aspects/give us more space).

One thing that I might have asked at the end of your talk yesterday (but didn&#039;t) is what the best way to start this process is - I&#039;d like someone to be able to tell me more than just &quot;pile in more loft insulation&quot; - someone who can tell me whether the solid brick wall that is part-inside/part-outside the house is an issue; whether the existing large windows at the front should be replaced (and if so what with!) and so on - but not with a vested interest in selling me product X or a purely box-ticking exercise...

How might someone go about finding that kind of consultant? Is someone in your list here a good starting point?

Many thanks again

John (&#038; Karen)]]></description>
