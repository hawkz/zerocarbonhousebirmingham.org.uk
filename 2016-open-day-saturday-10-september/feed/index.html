					<description><![CDATA[Hi John, I visited your inspiring house in 2016. It has taken a bit of time to act on the inspiration and the 2nd SuperHome I visited on Hawthorne Road.

I am putting together an Aspiring SuperHome application for 155 flats in 4 blocks at Park Central, in one development zone of many. Setting out improvements to get close to zero carbon for a development in Birmingham city centre which was only developed since 2003:

Geothermal replacement of communal gas heating (if feasible), solar and possibly micro wind. Electric vehicle charging points. Ceiling insulation, non passive air flow in summer, solar shielding for the summer.  LED communal lighting. Light tubes to windowless rooms. 

This is all dependent on getting support from other leaseholders to join Park Central RTM Company Limited, that is being constituted. 

I will update you on progress, and if I can get many other private blocks to join, to buy our Freeholds and take control of our buildings. There is a massive lag in environmental sustainability in leasehold flats. And no cooperation from absentee Freeholders and Managing Agents. 

Successes? Racor gravity bike stands to make unusable bicycle stores, useable with clear parking spaces and egress. 

Turning down pump on flat side of heat exchanger to lowest RPM, makes water pass through the heat exchanger 26% slower and exit hotter (thermocouple data loggers to be aquired to prove this).

Mira eco showerhead with 3 settings, aerates the water reducing unrestricted flow from 11 litres per min to 7 litres per min. (Thanks Hawthorne Rd SuperHome for this tip). 

Reduced total wattage load significantly, in flat to be detailed in Aspiring SuperHome application. 160 to 60 watts for new TV, look at https://www.sust-it.net (thanks Hawthorne Rd SuperHome for this link) approx 300 watts with low watt bulbs. Induction hob installation (instant like gas and no wasted heat) 15 watts from heat pump on lower setting.

3.5 litres per min tap aerators for bathroom and kitchen sinks reduced from 11 litres per min unrestricted. Installation of dishwasher.

					<description><![CDATA[Will you be having an open day in 2017? 
I am the Hon Sec of the Leicester Art and Design Group. We are a group of local retired professionals - medics, academics, architects and planners - who share an interest in modern architecture and design. I know that the group would be interested in seeing your house.
