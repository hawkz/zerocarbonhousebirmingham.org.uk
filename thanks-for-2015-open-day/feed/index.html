					<description><![CDATA[Hello

Gurg from RIBA told me about your house as I am interested in designing and building a similar one next door to where I live in Harborne, Birmingham. (I work in the cafe downstairs from their office.)  I would be very interested in having a visit to your house before I get started on my application.  I would be most greatful if you would be able to accommodate me either at the house, or, at your offices, or you could come into the cafe in Digbeth for our delicious Dish Of The Day, which is always fresh and healthy.  I would be happy to meet anywhere at your convenience.  Please feel free to call me on my mobile.

Kind Regards
