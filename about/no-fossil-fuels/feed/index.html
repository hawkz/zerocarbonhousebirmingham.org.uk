					<description><![CDATA[Hi Nigel Lloyd
That sounds really impressive and I love the name ACOCKS GREENER!
If you have a website or link I’d be very pleased to put it on Twitter? 
In response to your query, these are my first thoughts: 
1. You will have greatly reduced your home’s heating load/heat loss. 
2. As you already have PV &#038; a battery, much of the electricity you’re using will be renewable - and as the grid decarbonises, which it’s doing at an increasingly rate now, better than had been expected, any electricity you need to import will  be progressively greener. 
4. I guess with your solar PV you may have no roof space left for solar hot water panels? - but if you do, they are sometimes overlooked as “Cinderella” of renewables... Although they wouldn’t provide all the heat you need for space heating &#038; hot water the whole year around, they would certainly reduce your requirement. 
4. So building on 1&#038;2, with or without 3 above, I suggest you might consider a ground source heat pump or an air source heat pump in place of your fossil-fuel gas boiler for your remaining heating/hot water load?  There is still a government incentive scheme for these...
Best wishes]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You might be interested in our home. We have a 1958 end-terrace council house in Acocks Green which we have &#039;improved&#039;:
- added 10cm rock wool external wall insulation in addition to existing cavity wall insulation.
- installed MVHR
- converted loft into heavily insulated bedroom + ensuite bathroom with wall of N-facing window
- replaced floor slab (had to because red ash had been used as hardcore and floor had popped) and installed underfloor insulation and wet heating
- placed PV panels on S-facing pitched roof and &#039;flat&#039; roof and installed battery.
Now we would like to eliminate gas for hot water (washing, radiators in upstairs rooms). Any ideas?
We are also forming &#039;Acocks Greener&#039; to mobilise the community to respond to (and prevent) climate change, leading the change for Birmingham.]]></description>

Yes, it is an excellent product, see http://www.ecoflap.co.uk/
Our letterbox is triple-sealed.  It consists of an outer brass flap (not airtight, but hard-wearing and matching our reclaimed brass door hanles), then the Ecoflap inside (very good airtightness).  Letters go into an internal compartment with a further air-sealed internal door.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Its a heat store of 1000 litres, ie about 5x a normal domestic cylinder.  Our solar panels on the roof will fill the tank with hot water. The large size of the store is so that even in winter on frosty/sunny days we hope to get a reasonable input, which will tide us over if we then get a number of cloudy days.  Its been put together by GreenShop Solar http://www.greenshopsolar.co.uk/

The ventilation system is mechanical ventilation heat recovery as used in German Passivhaus design and is made by Itho http://www.itho.co.uk/Products/HRU_ECO_4/Default.aspx?id=19
System designed by The Green Building Store http://www.greenbuildingstore.co.uk/ but we have added a special heater battery so the solar store can add heat into the mvhr if required]]></description>
