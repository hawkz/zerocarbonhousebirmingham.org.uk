					<description><![CDATA[&quot;A zero carbon house is one that does not increase the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere (net carbon emissions over the course of a year).&quot;

Net zero = we don&#039;t emit more CO2 than we soak up.
Gross zero = bare minimum of all greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted.  A very necessary and worthwhile attempt to achieve that bare minimum existence!

Please could you explain what you mean by zero &quot;net carbon emissions&quot; that I have always felt is a loophole to avoid more stringent lifestyle/behavioural changes.  I&#039;m striving for gross zero of all greenhouse gases (GHG).

And how do you measure net zero?  Gross zero is measured by being totally off-grid for both electricity and gas, isn&#039;t it?  Net zero must depend on peat, soil, plants absorbing CO2.  Is that right?  Yet, forests are burning in hotter summers and peat continues to be depleted and degraded by drought.  Ten of the most important forests are now giving off more CO2 than they absorb, I read the other week in the Guardian!]]></description>
