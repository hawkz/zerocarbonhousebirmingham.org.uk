					<description><![CDATA[Good afternoon,

I am a Civil engineering student at the University of Birmingham and I&#039;m currently producing a research project on investigating the barriers preventing zero carbon housing across the UK. I am enquiring into whether it would be possible to view the house especially if there are any open days in the near future and/or hopefully speak to someone regarding the development process and the maintenance of the house. This would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Lewis.]]></description>
